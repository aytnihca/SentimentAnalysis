95260,Guanfacine,ADHD,"""My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. 
We have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective.""",8,27-Apr-10,192
92703,Lybrel,Birth Control,"""I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.
The positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.""",5,14-Dec-09,17

At first It decreased my libido but that subsided. The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control. Other than that in happy with the patch""",8,3-Nov-15,10

Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&#039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.""",10,14-Mar-15,32
48928,Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had been on the pill for many years. When my doctor changed my RX to chateal, it was as effective. It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though. I did not gain extra weight, or develop any emotional health issues. I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28. I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now. I&#039;m also naturally moody, so this may worsen things. I was in a negative mental rut today. Also I hope this doesn&#039;t push me over the edge, as I believe I am depressed. Hopefully it&#039;ll be just like when I was younger.""",8,8-Dec-16,1

I&#039;ve never had acne problems in my life, and immediately broke out after getting it implanted. Sex drive is completely gone, and I used to have sex with my boyfriend a few days a week, now its completely forced and not even fun for me anymore. I mean I&#039;m on birth control because I like having sex but don&#039;t want to get pregnant, why take a birth control that takes away sex?

81890,Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I have been taking Saxenda since July 2016.  I had severe nausea for about a month once I got up to the 2.6 dosage.  It has since subsided and the only side effect I notice now is the dry mouth.  I make sure to drink  2.5 litres of water a day (about 10 glasses).  This helps with the weight loss as well as the constipation.  I have been reducing my dose to find a comfortable spot where I am still losing weight but don&#039;t feel like I am over medicating.  For me, 1.8 is working very well.  I also feel wearing a Fitbit has really helped.  I can track my food, water, exercise and steps - it keeps me moving more.  When this started I could barely walk the length of myself without getting winded - I have lost 58 lbs so far.""",9,19-Jan-17,20

Within a few days of starting Lamictal (was on Tegretol) it was as if someone had turned a light on in my head. Is this the way &quot;normal&quot; people think? was one of the first things that struck me. I sleep like a log, have no irritability, almost no anger (other than what would be considered normal). I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It&#039;s a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted. My libido is markedly lower but I wonder if that is perhaps an effect of not being hypo manic. I take 20 mg for anxiety.""",10,9-Nov-14,18

My story begins with my PCP prescribing me Prozac to help with intestinal issues, because I was desperate I tried it, I was on it for 3 weeks. Stopped because of insomnia. Then I was prescribed Ativan, it out me out, but was very addicting. I had rebound insomnia. Then after about 14 days I hardly any sleep l tried the doctor one more time. I asked him about Trazadone. He told me that was a good medication for insomnia. He put me on 25 mgs, but stated I may have to figure out what dosage is best for me. I am currently taking 100 mgs, which is on the low range of what is prescribed, 400 mgs being at the high end for insomnia. I have the dry mouth and nasel congestion.

78563,Daytrana,ADHD,"""Hi all, My son who is 12 was diagnosed when he was in 2nd grade. We tried everything before medication. When we tried meds, the first one made him loose weight, fast. The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework. He does have issues with weight gain and sleep but he uses melatonin before bed if he feels like he will not be able to shut down. The shortage is KILLING us!""",10,12-Jan-17,11

It has been an interesting experience because the drug is definitely not an appetite suppressant, yet it does help you control the urge to eat. I have had mild side effects - some stomach discomfort and slight headaches along with constipation, but it has all been easily manageable. If you are considering taking this medication please keep in mind that you still need to do the work by exercising and eating right, but the medication really does help. It has helped me get my motivation back to exercise, and it definitely helps with cravings to eat making it easy to just eat what I need to be healthy.

However, I&#039;m also on a pretty high dose of Lexapro, and the Dr. thinks it&#039;s more likely to be a side effect of that, so we&#039;re decreasing that and hopefully that will work, because otherwise I&#039;m feeling really good.

I had some moderate acne before taking the pill, and was needing to get back on a birth control and figured that yaz would be a good bet. Well, I have really zero side effects with yaz. Which I was so happy with. I still have a sex drive, I don&#039;t get headaches, bitchiness, or stomach aches. Overall, great pill. I had read the reviews about the pill before going on it and noticed most people had an initial first break out period with it getting better until month 3, so true! The first two months were hell, terrible breakouts I would say the worst in my life. But I am now in month four, and am hardly breaking out! Wait it out, it will pay off!""",9,7-Jul-15,16

I was very apathetic and exhausted for no reason - I never adjusted my eating or sleeping habits so I had nothing other to attribute it to than the implant. So July 2015 (14 month in) I had my first full blown period. Then a week later I had another and then a week after that I started spotting. It&#039;s now Sept 15 and my marathon period is still happening. I saw my gyno and I&#039;ve been taking estadiol daily which is only slightly helping.

I took my cousins advice and cut the pill in half, taking only 25mg a day which works really well for me.I&#039;m 5&#039;4, 130lbs.

In all honesty it helps my leg and lets me focus at work. I&#039;ve tried the norco and vicodin es,also lyrica and gabapentin but I&#039;m not a fan. I dislike the nausea feeling and the grogginess.

Probably no good for bipolars on the high energy side.  It&#039;s therapeutic, too - unlike lithium it&#039;s there working all the time.

For the first 3 months or so my face became dry, red, and irritated. I used moisturizer to combat the dryness but it was irritating. Using my my old s acid face wash stung so bad. My acne also got worse during these first three months. A lot of whiteheads and bumps that never fully emerged. I pushed through thanks to these reviews and by the 4 month, things started looking up. Now my face is mostly clear and scars are beginning to fade and the irritation and dryness have improved a bit. To all you struggling, keep it up!""",8,14-Feb-16,25

A dermatologist in Scotland put me on to this (Duac 12mg/g 50mg/g gel) and explained it is TO BE USED SPARINGLY. i.e. do not rub it all over your face or it will not only burn and dry your skin (which in turn will cause your sebacious glands to activate to moisturise your skin which can lead to get more acne infection) but also make your system more resistant to the antibiotic.

IMPORTANT: Apply to each pimple individual and slightly around the area, not all over your face or back

They say it is different for everyone, apparently my pain threshold is much lower than other women. This sharp pain and cramping cause immediate tears and a small yelp. Immediately after, I became very pale and lightheaded and had to use the restroom. I could hardly sit up in the bathroom because I was so lightheaded and nausea caused me to vomit. I was so weak and honestly wanted to just lie on the floor because I began to sweat. After about 30 minutes, I was able to stand up and drive home. The cramps and nausea remained very severe until the next morning. Ibuprofen and heating pads helped me sleep that night.""",10,9-May-17,3

I have also had chronic back pain for the past 7 years and my doctor wanted to switch me to Cymbalta. Well, the transition/withdrawal has been terrible. A lot if crying and panicking for no reason, crawling skin, etc. I took one Vistaril, and found it very helpful.  My Dr. has prescribed Vistaril 25-50 mg every 6 hours as needed.

I now have to get my gallbladder removed and I think it has to do with taking psychiatric drugs over the years. It is well noted now that abilify causes gallstones, a fatty liver and high triglycerides.

So disappointed not too mention the cost is more than double for me.  Don&#039;t know if the dose is just two low considering how long I&#039;ve been on pain meds  Guess I could ask him to up it to 40mg and see if that works.  20mg isn&#039;t hacking it at all.

Within a couple weeks of taking 75 mg I still yawned a lot but I wasn%u2019t having trouble with lethargy and sleep issues as much. My attitude was much better. For example, I found that I really am a funny and silly person! I forgot that I was funny being under depression. I didn%u2019t realize how serious I had become, how reclusive. I also found my creativity really opened up. I had forgotten how creative I was. I also have been going to the gym and eating well. I try and smile and interact with people more%u2014even if I don%u2019t feel like it. I may just greet people or hold the door for them but it%u2019s better than me avoiding people like I used to.

I ate crackers and drank water while sitting. I&#039;d advise eating before. I went in hungry and feel that is what made me light headed. I drove after and went to the market.

The only side effect I have is dry mouth.  For me it totally cuts out my appetite, I don&#039;t crave any sweets ( my weakness )  I cut out sugar and salt all together, and I used Slim Fast for the times I didn&#039;t have time to make something.  I ate more fruits and veggies.  I also completely stayed away from soda.  I don&#039;t have any problems sleeping.  When you are on Adipex you have to be seen by your doctor each month, the maximum time allowed on Adipex is 3 months.  Because of the risk of becoming addicted and other health risk that could develop.  After a few months you can get back on them, if so desired.   Because your only can be on Apidex 3 months at a time, the challenge will be keeping the weight off after.  I know for me it&#039;s like it puts a block on all my bad snacking and cuts out all my cravings.

Two main points- first, my period hasn&#039;t changed much. Still lasts 5 days, with 1-2 days of bleeding on the heavier side. No, I don&#039;t have to change my tampon every hour =)

As for the cramps, mine have actually IMPROVED. I don&#039;t even have to take midol anymore!! My cramps used to be a constant, dull ache that would last all day- they were terrible. With Paragard they come in short waves (lasting for like 10 seconds). They are so much more bearable now!

It certainly doesn&#039;t do this for me--I may as well be applying lotion for all the good it does me.  It really does nothing at all.

I&#039;m really disappointed, as my pain management doctor just weaned me off of narcotics, so I don&#039;t have anything that helps with the pain at the moment.

I was extremely fatigued, couldn&#039;t start or finish easy tasks, totally overwhelmed, cried constantly - major post-partum depression. Was prescribed Adderall, Wellbutrin and Zoloft. Been on all 3 for 1 year and am a completely new person. Adderall doesn&#039;t exacerbate my anxiety; in fact, I am less anxious because I can concentrate and don&#039;t feel exhausted, inadequate and unhappy. Might not work for all, but this combination is perfect for me. Upped blood pressure a bit, but still in normal range and monitored. Use with care with dose at start. I cut pills and take a bit at a time, always in the morning and only when needed during the rest of the day and never more than prescribed. I feel this lessens risk of dependency.""",10,6-May-09,117

I&#039;ve now had a headache for almost 6 weeks straight, most days are so bad that I have to take Excedrin or Ibuprofen, I&#039;m anxious most of the time, not sleeping well - and now it&#039;s gotten to the point where my coworkers and family are noticing.  So I went to my primary care physician worried that I was depressed and he said I need to get off of this BC and try something new.  In general, I&#039;m just really disappointed.

My memory became terrible and I felt emotionally dead inside l. Some moments I couldn&#039;t get out of bed and others, I couldn&#039;t sit still. After two weeks, she increased my dose to 75 mg.

He was not sad, per se, just in a state of chronic malaise coupled with chronic fatigue, i.e. not being able to stay awake more then 2 or 3 hours at a time. Finally, we were able to find a Doctor who was familiar with head injuries and the low level of dopamine that the victim is often left with. Wellbutrin is a dopamine and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor so it is really working great for our son. It was literally like flicking his switch back &quot;on&quot;.

On day 3 I developed a huge rash on my inner thigh and then on my shoulders.  I had strange nightmares and felt out of sorts.  I then had irritability and snapped at my husband and young son on several occasions after day 5. On day six I stood up and felt dizzy and weird.  I developed anxiety and felt upset.

I sleep naturally but my sleep isn&#039;t as good as it was before i.e. I wake up several times throughout the night. I don&#039;t know if this is an effect of month-long Zolpidem use.

It is a very serious medication and I strongly suggest you don&#039;t use it if you can get along with anything else.

Cymbalta is AMAZING.  After about 2 weeks the side effects disappeared entirely.  I can concentrate better, I sleep VERY soundly, and no panic attacks!

For those having insomnia issues... some people here say take it at night.  I had exactly the OPPOSITE experience.  Taking Cymbalta at night/dinner time would make sleep nearly impossible/restless.

To all the people that say tretinoin breaks you out, either in pill or cream form, that is its process. You can not use it for 1 week, see pimples and stop, it is not making your skin worse, it is getting anything under neath the surface of your face out to eventually clear it, that is what you want.

I didn&#039;t have any spotting until 4 days later and minimal cramping nothing to bad. The first day was the most most uncomfortable day but after that I felt fine.

After three months on Klonopin every day, and after the SSRI kicked in, I stepped off the Klonopin without any withdrawals like you read about on the internet.

My skin cleared up, besides a few pimples around my period, I gained maybe 5 pounds (my breasts got larger, but who&#039;s complaining), and as someone who suffers from generalized anxiety disorder, I have found no issues.  There are only two negatives that I have found: if you forget to take a pill, you start spotting. My friends who take yaz have similar experiences.

It&#039;s not a miracle drug that just melts the weight off. You have to put forth the effort to listen to your mind more and not just your want to eat.

This medication works great for a lot of people when other things fail, just be aware that the trade off is that some annoying side effects are fairly common.

Think of the worst flu you ever had...it&#039;s kinda like that but worse.  And all the anxiety comes back in full force.

The week before my period I always got aggravated easily too which was odd cause I&#039;m a very mellow person. No weight gain though! The first month it did make me a little emotional but after that I really didn&#039;t have any emotions (which was the problem). However I really do miss this medication.

As a thirty-something, in-shape mother of two, I have zero time for naps so, fatigue was not a livable option for me. I&#039;m actually really surprised by the weight gain as I hit the gym daily.

The Depo is very effective and is great preventing pregnancy, I barely get periods anymore, and the unwanted hair on my body started going away.

The first 2 days of taking Jolivette I had major headaches, nausea and dizziness so I bought complex B vitamin and took along with almonds and blue berries which helped me a lot.

It has reduced my depression and anxiety considerably, in addition to this, I had over time, developed a social phobia. I was always falling asleep and felt like I was turning into a junkie due to the the oxycontin medicines I was on for pain.

Qsymia definitely helps control hunger, but it does not eliminate your ability to eat a lot  if you chose to. It just gives you the choice.

I&#039;ve been on 5mg for the last 4 months. And, I must say that it has changed my life for the better.  I no longer have those negative thoughts or bouts of anxiety. Its amazing.

Acutane is the nuclear option. It cuts off all moisture to your face, and your face basically presses the reset button and figures out that sending all that oil isn&#039;t a good idea. Of course, that means your lips are chapped, your face is dry, and you&#039;ll probably get nosebleeds. To me, that was more than worth it.

Thanks to Ortho Evra, my periods are now only 6 days (3 days of heavy to moderate bleeding, then 3 days of spotting).  That is seriously a miracle for me!  Also, I have less period cramps than before (although my pre-patch period cramps were never really anything to complain about).  Besides this, my breasts have also grown bigger (which my boyfriend loves).  Although, I have experienced some negative side effects too.  My breasts were REALLY tender for the first 2 months, but this has mostly gone away.  Sometimes, on my Patch change days in September and October, I would feel a little bit nauseous or lightheaded, but I think this may have been partially or completely psychological.  Also, sometimes, even when I&#039;m not near my period, I will experience very mild cramping.  But these are all side effects that I can live with.

Third week the symptoms set aside and I was a bit better but still felt robotic.

62694,Citalopram,Depression,"""I was started off on a 10mg dose of fluoxetine and had bad nausea so my doctor switched me over to Celexa. I have been on it for a few months and it has helped, I had to be upped to a 20mg dose though. I have a really hard time getting to sleep also. But for the most part I like it. I actually found it increased my sex drive.""",8,30-Jul-09,7
190374,Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo,Birth Control,"""I took Ortho Tri-Cyclen because this is what I received from the health department for free when I didn&#039;t have insurance and was a poor full time student. I was taking this for about 4 years. The best thing about it is that I never got pregnant. However, I had extremely heavy periods lasting 5-6 days until it was finished completely; painful cramps, spotting lightly at times, spotting heavily; mood swings; fatigue and recurrent yeast infections. I finally made it back to my regular OBGYN after getting insurance again and she placed me on Beyaz. So far so good.""",5,10-Apr-12,1
107644,Implanon,Birth Control,"""I have had the Implanon birth control for almost 2 years now.  Ever since I have got it my sex drive has gone up, which is great, on the other hand though I bleed like crazy!  I will have a period for a week to 2 months sometimes.  Other times I will have my period then two weeks later have another one.  The bleeding is the only part that drives me insane.  I did gain a little bit of weight but it seems like most people always gain some weight when using a birth control.  Lately though,  I keep having thoughts and feelings that I am pregnant.  I don&#039;t usually have cramps but the last 2 times I bled I was in severe pain.""",6,1-Aug-10,0
228202,Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had the Implanon inserted 07/23/09 so its been around 3 months. I have nothing good to say about it. I have terrible acne break outs, I have had constant bleeding the whole time. I&#039;m cramping nearly everyday, I have had nausea, hair loss, mood swings, weight gain, zero sex drive. I am getting out the 30th of September and going back to Yaz. """,1,19-Sep-09,7
7817,Xanax,Anxiety,"""Less panic attacks and helps keep you relaxed and open minded. Less stress keeps you panic free and it lowers the stress at least 75% while on the Xanax compared to Lexapro and many others I tried for anxiety and depression.""",10,16-Aug-10,21
134280,Lidoderm,Pain,"""The Mylan lidocaine patches are a waste of money!  They don&#039;t stay on your skin for more 2-3 hours. The problems with patches is the patch is not breathable and the adhesive does not move with your body.""",2,6-Mar-17,19
18152,Ethinyl estradiol / etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""Love Nuvaring. At first I was a little nervous about using it. I thought my boyfriend would be weirded out, but that was not the case. He can&#039;t even feel it during sex. Perfect to use. It helps me know exactly when I am going to get my period. My only suggestion would be not to forget to put it back in if you take it out during sex( because the guy may feel it) you will start your period early.""",9,6-Apr-11,1
